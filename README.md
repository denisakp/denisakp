### Hi there, it's me Denis <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">

I'm that guy from Togo 🇹🇬 who design, build and maintain scalable and robust back-end apps using NodeJS, Pyhon, PHP and Golang.

I also have a lot of attraction with docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, Github and DigitalOcean for CI/CD stuffs.

#### PS: 
* css is my phobia
* I prefer using [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) rather than [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/fr/) or [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) 😎. 
* I don't have money for a [Mac](https://www.apple.com/fr/macbook-pro-14-and-16/) or [Windows license](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-windows-11) so I use [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) 😍
