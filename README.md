# Hi there! 👋

I'm Denis, a software engineer, public speaker, and open-source contributor passionate about building robust distributed systems and empowering teams through DevSecOps practices. I specialize in cloud-native architectures, distributed systems, and secure software delivery, helping organizations ship features faster while maintaining security and operational excellence.

With over 5 years of experience in distributed architectures and cloud-native ecosystems, I've helped teams optimize their development workflows and reduce operational costs. I create technical content, including blog posts, conference talks, and open-source tools—that bridges the gap between theory and practice, making complex distributed systems concepts accessible to developers worldwide.

I believe in pragmatic engineering, clean architecture, and continuous improvement. Whether it's designing scalable microservices, implementing secure CI/CD pipelines, or sharing knowledge with the community, I'm driven by building systems that are both resilient and maintainable. Always learning.

Always building. Always sharing.
