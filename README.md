I'm Denis Yaovi

I excel in designing, developing, and maintaining secure, scalable, and high-performance softwares, with a deep interrest for the Cloud Native ecosystem and enthusiasm for contributing to open source softwares.

- I am a software engineer:  I design, build, test, deploy, and maintain applications using open source technologies to efficiently handle a variety of challenges.
- I am a Linux systems operator: using Docker, and Kubernetes, I can scale and orchestrate the software I craft
- I am a tech support: Docker helps me to reproduce issues
- I am a technical writer: I write clear docs for projects, to enable users and fellow developers understand how to use or maintain a software
