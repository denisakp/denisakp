**More than just a Software Engineer, I'm a digital craftsman**. I pour my expertise and passion into every project, building high-performing, elegant, and secure softwares.

**I'm also a true believer in DevOps and Cloud Native technologies**. I'm convinced these approaches dramatically improve the speed, reliability, and scalability of IT infrastructure.

**Open source is a core value for me**. I'm an **aspiring contributor** to open-source projects and always on the lookout for new ways to share my knowledge and support the community. I recently discovered the power of open source through my participation in the first cohort of the **All In Africa program by GitHub**. This experience ignited my passion for c**ontributing and being part of this collaborative movement**.

**In a nutshell, I'm a passionate web developer, a DevOps/Cloud Native expert, and an enthusiastic advocate for open source**. I'm constantly seeking new challenges and eager to bring my skills and experience to design, build, develop, test, deploy and maintain real world projects.
