### Hi there, it's me Denis <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">

Passionate technophile skilled in back end development for different kind of services.
Useful knowledge and experience with high level programming by using trending technologies.

Currently working mostly with NodeJS to build RESTfull APIs based on micro-service architecture. CSS is my phobia ðŸ˜¢ but i have some experience with front-end technologies like ReactJS and VueJS.
I can just create the project and make it work that's all ðŸ˜….
